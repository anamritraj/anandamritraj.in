First of all Merry Christmas everyone! I hope you all are enjoying your holidays!

Let's talk about why I created this blog and what I plan to do with it.

This blog is the result of me buying domains names + always looking for trying some new tech stack + Twitter + my forgetful mind.

I will walk you through each one of them in order.

## Me buying domain names

Whenever I see a sale, I buy some domain names for any projects that I will make in future. Recently, I bought this anamritraj.tech. Didn't know what I would do with it until now!

## Always looking for new tech stack
Recently I heard about the JAM stack and wanted to try it. So here we are!

## Twitter

## My Mind

I tend to forget things I have done in past! I create a lot of small scripts, solve a lot of puzzles and do some competitive programming. I forget it all after a while.

This will be like my diary for all those things. I will try to be consistent and post stuff which I try/do/break.

Until then, Happy Holidays!
